    <h1>Mastering the Art of Google</h1>

<p>If you’re teaching yourself programming, Google is going to become your best friend (and mentor).</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time solving problems at work, and one of the best ways to get a better handle on an IT problem is to Google it.</p>

<p><em>The first key to Googling effectively is persistence</em>. When I’m trying to find an answer to a question I have, I could google several different queries and look at several different webpages - some of them I might come back to several times in an effort to process the information. It’s easy to get overwhelmed but you need to stick with it in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people will be really surprised that I used Google to solve a particular problem. Knowing the right things to search and how to weed through all of the results is crucial to finding the information you need. With the right set of skills, Google can be the answer to pretty much anything. And the best part is, it’s instant! No endlessly refreshing, waiting for someone to reply on a forum. If you know what to find, you can probably find it.</p>

<h2>Not knowing what to search for</h2>

<p>Someone once said to me, “sometimes you don’t know what you don’t know”. </p>

<p>Especially in the early stages of learning to program, you may not be able to pinpoint exactly what the problem is. There are usually three ways to remedy this:</p>

<h3>Try Google anyway</h3>

<p>Chances are, someone may have asked as vague a question as the one you have now, so try just typing a question into Google’s search box the same way you might casually ask someone else: </p>

<h3>Read everything.</h3>

<p>If you’re not sure what to look for, chances are you don’t fully understand some basic concepts. Read through whatever tutorial you’re following or textbook you’re reading. Google “beginner’s guide to [your topic here]” or “all about [topic]”. Once you familiarize yourself with what you’re trying to tackle, you’ll probably have a bunch of new terms and concepts to search for.</p>

<h3>Ask someone more experienced.</h3>

<p>This is where chatrooms really excel, whether you’re using IRC, Slack or Discord. While it takes someone a while to parse through your code and comment on why a particular line might not be working, asking a more general question like, “hey, what is called when ….” is much more easily answered off the top of someone’s head. That way, when someone responds “it sounds like you want to use a callback function”, you’ll have some new terminology to Google.</p>

<h2>Weeding the Results</h2>

<p>Google returns a ridiculous number of results, scaling down the amount depending on how specific you are. To get better results, be specific.</p>

<p>I like to use a technique that I like to call “word vomit” where I just list all of the related things that may find me someone’s post who was in a similar situation to me.</p>

<p>One time, I wanted to include colored output to a command-line game I was working on in Repl.it. I wanted to optimize it for Repl.it because I knew I was going to be sharing a link with my friend, and I wanted them to be able to play my CLI game without having to download and run my script.</p>

<p>First, I tried: <span class="google">Ruby command line colors</span> but I found that a lot of the code suggested by top rated posts weren’t working. Rather than try and troubleshoot the new code I found&hellip;</p>

<h3>Take into account the big picture</h3>

<p>I wasn’t <em>just</em> using colors in Ruby, I was using it with Ruby and Repl.it. Maybe some of the traditional way to get colors through a program worked with Ruby but not with Ruby on Repl.it. So I googled this phrase: <span class="google">replit ruby command line colors</span> and immediately found something that helped me.</p>

<p>Just stack words on top of each other in your queries if you want to return websites that relate to your unique situation. When I was working on building this website, I prefixed a bunch of my search terms with: <span class="google">middleman ruby github pages &hellip;</span> because I was using Middleman (a Ruby gem) and hosting it on Github pages. Sometimes picking something only related to Middleman wasn&rsquo;t relevant to me, so including them both worked really well.</p>

<h2>Google-Fu, a deeper look</h2>

<p>I thought it would be fun to write a small series of posts documenting how I solve issues I run into using Google. Click the link below to read my first one!</p>
