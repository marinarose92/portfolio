    <div class="blog-title"><h1>How I used Ruby to automate a tedious project</h1></div>
  <div class="article">
    <p>At my job, I wear many hats. One of them more recently has been email administration for an entire library consortium.</p>

<p>One of the tasks I was given is to sort through an Excel sheet of 1500 users - most of which were repeated more than once - and find the handful of them whose email domain names were changing and update their addresses. So basically I just needed to change <code>firstname.lastname@website.org</code> to <code>firstname.lastname@library.website.org</code> for about a hundred or so different users every time they appear.</p>

<p>Usually this would be a pretty simple search &amp; replace solution but I had a couple of obstacles:</p>

<ul>
<li>There were nine libraries migrating to nine unique subdomains.</li>
<li>Since the users’ old accounts had a generic @website.org address, there was no way of telling who belonged to which library so I had to constantly refer back to a list of users to make sure I was assigning them to the correct subdomain.</li>
<li>There were users with the @website.org domain who were staying the same, so I couldn’t just do a batch-replace per library, even if I had an idea of who belonged where.</li>
<li>The people whose e-mail domains I had to change were repeated in more than one place, which means I would need to make several replacements per user.</li>
</ul>

<p>I really, really have a poor attention span for tedious tasks and I was eager to get out of doing this manually as best as I could. Then I had an idea: Ruby.</p>

<p>I had previously finished a project of building a command line Hangman game that used serialization to import and export external files. I wanted to use that knowledge to help me here, so I switched over to my laptop running Linux and I opened a blank file.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was make two separate text files: one of the users’ old email addresses and one of the users’ new email addresses. It looked a little like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    old_emails.txt
    user1@website.org
    user2@website.org
    user3@website.org


    new_emails.txt
    user1@library1.website.org
    user2@library2.website.org
    user3@library3.website.org
</code></pre></div>
<p>They were already sorted in the exact same order because I had this information in two cells of a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to map one value to another and then use that information to only change the affected users. I had only worked with hashes peripherally and didn’t really understand how they might be useful in certain situations, but it finally made sense.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was create a class and some class variables that would take the information from the files and eventually turn them into an array.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="vc">@@emails_new</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"emails_new.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="vc">@@emails_old</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"emails_old.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="vc">@@emails_new_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vc">@@emails_new</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="vc">@@emails_old_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vc">@@emails_old</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once I had two arrays of e-mail addresses, I googled how to create a hash using two ordered arrays to create a key-value pair. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">emails_hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="vc">@@emails_old_arr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="vc">@@emails_new_arr</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">transpose</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_h</span><span class="sb">`
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it worked!</p>

<p>Then I made another text file consisting of my original list of 1500+ users with the old addresses that needed to be changed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="vc">@@all_emails</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"all_emails.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="vc">@@all_emails_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vc">@@all_emails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">split</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And finally, an array to store the changed results:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="vc">@@fixed_emails_arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I was ready to start working on logic. I wanted to sort through every user in my <code>@@all_emails_arr array</code>, but don&rsquo;t change the ones that we don&rsquo;t need to change. I figured the best way to do it would just be to compare each e-mail with each key in the hash. To demonstrate, my hash looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code>    <span class="n">emails_hash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s2">"user1@website.org"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"user1@library1.website.org"</span>
        <span class="s2">"user2@website.org"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"user2@library2.website.org"</span>
        <span class="s2">"user3@website.org"</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"user3@library3.website.org"</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, if it did indeed match, then I wanted to replace the original e-mail with the key&rsquo;s value - the corrected e-mail. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code>    <span class="c1"># iterate through all addresses (in alphabetical order)</span>
    <span class="vc">@@all_emails_arr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sort!</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="c1"># if the email matches a hash key</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">emails_hash</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">has_key?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="c1"># push the hash *value* to the final array</span>
        <span class="vc">@@fixed_emails_arr</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">emails_hash</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">values_at</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="c1"># push the current value to the array</span>
        <span class="vc">@@fixed_emails_arr</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">email</span>
        <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This worked! But I needed a better way to output the changed data since there was so much of it. It would be ideal if I could just print it out into a text file as a list that I could just copy back into my spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The second part of our Hangman project was to save our game state using <code>YAML</code>. I remembered how it printed out the arrays I saved in a nice little list and decided to see if it could do the job!</p>

<p>I added this bit of code to do the work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">yaml</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">YAML</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">dump</span><span class="p">({</span>
        <span class="ss">:fixed_emails_arr</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="vc">@@fixed_emails_arr</span>
    <span class="p">})</span>
    <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"new_emails.yml"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"w"</span><span class="p">){</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yaml</span><span class="p">)}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I ran my code again, crossed my fingers, and checked my newly generated <code>new_emails.yml</code> file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">user1@library1.website.org</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">user2@library2.website.org</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">user3@library3.website.org</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>All I had to do was bulk replace the &lsquo;- &rsquo; with nothing to remove that undesired bit, but then I was ready to replace the contents of my spreadsheet with my updated information.</p>

<p>It took me about 40 minutes to code this and I&rsquo;m confident it saved me more than a couple hours of mindless and tedious work. I ended up feeling super proud of finding a way around it and using my Ruby knowledge along the way! </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t doubt there are alternative or even massively easier ways to figure this out. But I figured it would be fun to share how I did.</p>

<p>Here is my final code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EmailMigration</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'yaml'</span>
